## Testing

Because we were plagued with memory leak issues, we decided to use curl to test single requests,
instead of running the test suite, which subjects the server to multiple requests in
a row. With curl, we tested GETs and HEADs on non-existing and existing files (to generate
404s and 200s, respectively), and we also used the -F option to POST form data to a resource.
While we were able to get these requests working and respond to them correctly, doing the
same for the testing suite provided by autograder proved near impossible.

## Vulnerabilities

  1. slow loris attacks: There is no timeout on a client connection. The client could open a connection and leave it open without sending a request. This would eventually exhaust our socket file descriptors.
  2. large request header fields: we do not dynamically size buffers to read the incoming header field data. It would be trivial to crash the server with lengthy header field value.
  3. large request bodies: ditto
